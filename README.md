# Project Title

Exploring and Visualizing Patterns in Star Wars Survey data.

# Overview

In this simple project, we focus of looking for patterns and visualizing them menus using the __Pandas__, __Numpy__ and __Matplotlib__.

The dataset was compiled by [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) and can be downloaded from here : https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey.

The dataset is in .csv format and should be present in your working directory as 'star_wars.csv' if you wish to run the notebook.

Suggestions for improvements will be highly appreciated!
